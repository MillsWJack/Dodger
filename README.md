### SDL2
Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. 

### Dodger

A recreation of a classic dodging game, made with all of my own art, own SFX, and borrowed music¹.

Control with either 'A' and 'D' or ← and 	→

**Try to dodge all of the incoming asteroids! Your score will increase as you do so, but be careful - the higher your score, the more asteroids will spawn!**
